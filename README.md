This repo provides you step-by-step instructions 
to get a new custom program running on a server in the cloud, 
then make a change.

There are many variations to this exercise:

   * Repositories GitHub vs. GitLab vs. Bitbucket
   * Continuous integration utilities Jenkins vs. Circle-CI vs. Shippable, etc.
   * Scripting with Maven vs. Ansible declarative statements
   * Instantiate using scripts vs. Kubernetes
   * Databases used by the application MongoDB vs. Postgres, etc.
   * Instantiate database as a separate server vs. mlab vs. compose clouds
   * Cloud environments Heroku vs. AWS vs. Azure vs. Google vs. Rackspace

We condust this exercise so you can realistically compare 
the true effort needed for each choice of technologies.

Let's start with using GitHub, Jenkins, Heroku, and mlab,
which all offer free usage options.

The intended audience for demo are 
<strong>DevOps</strong> cloud system administrators supporting
<strong>developers</strong>.
