This repo provides you step-by-step instructions to get
<a href="#SampleApp">a sample app</a>
running on a server in the cloud.
We then make a change and update the server through an automated continuous integration
<a href="#Pipelines">"pipepline"</a>.

The intent of this effort is to vary the
DevOps technologies used so you can realistically compare
the true effort needed for each <a href="#TechChoices">
choice of technologies</a>.

   * Repositories GitHub vs. GitLab vs. Bitbucket
   * Continuous integration utilities Jenkins vs. Circle-CI vs. Shippable
   * Scripting with Maven scripts vs. declarative statements

   * Bare metal vs. virtual instances vs. Docker containers
   * Operating system CentOS vs. Ubuntu vs. RedHat
   * Build in VMs vs. Dockerhub
   * Build from scratch vs. reuse builds in Artifactory
   * Instantiate using Kubernetes

   * Databases used by the application MongoDB vs. Postgres, etc.
   * Instantiate database as a separate server vs. mlab vs. compose clouds
   * Cloud environment Digital Ocean vs. Heroku vs. AWS vs. Azure vs. Google vs. Rackspace

   * Testing of functional performance and capacity
   * Logging for traceability
   * Monitoring
   * Scalability for enterprise use

## Choice of technologies #

From the above menu there can be many combinations.

So let's first build the <a href="#MostCommonDevOps">
most common DevOps technologies in use today</a>,<br />
then substitute one piece at a time to observe the difference.

The first substitute Jenkins with
<strong>Shippable</strong> for continuous integration
to see the impact of:

   * Scripting with Maven scripts in Jenkins vs. declarative statements
   * A single pipeline view in Jenkins vs. several on a single pane of glass (SPOG)
   * Sharing variables/state between jobs
   * Chaining jobs
   * Mix build triggers with parametized builds

BTW, the intended audience for this article are experienced
<strong>developers</strong> who want to focus on innovation and
<strong>DevOps</strong> cloud system administrators supporting developers.

## Sample Apps #

We have 2 micro-services, each defined in a separate repo:

0. A cron service called <strong>Box</strong>.
   This updates into MongoDB a periodic heart beat
   to show it's still up and running<br />
   (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ttrahan-beta/box">https://github.com/ttrahan-beta/box</a>)

0. A visualizer UI called <strong>dv</strong>
   that connects to the MongoDB Box updated by Box and
   draws whatever cron services are updating TTL (Time To Live)<br />
   (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ttrahan-beta/dv">https://github.com/ttrahan-beta/dv</a>)

Because we have two apps, we can see when
one service i.e. box or dv changes,
only the changed image should be deployed.
We donâ€™t want to deploy the entire app when one component changes.

Integrated tests are at
https://github.com/ttrahan-beta/test

QUESTION: What about different branches of https://github.com/aye0aye/box

Files in these repos are described when appropriate below.

   * **package.json** defines Node packages to be installed.
   * **server.js** is the file Node invokes.

   * **Gruntfile.js**

   * **bower.json** and bower_components folder
   * **static** folder

   * **shippable.yml**
   * <a href="#Dockerize">**Dockerfile**</a> to "Dockerize" the app

   * **build.sh**
   * **boot.sh**
   * **push.sh**

GitHub, CentOS, Jenkins, on Digital Ocean,
referencing a database in mlab.
These all offer free (or nearly free) usage options.
